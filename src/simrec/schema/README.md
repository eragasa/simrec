## `simrec` Schema Licensing Rationale
The schemas are released under CC0-1.0 to allow unrestricted reuse as an open specification.

The schemas in this directory define the structural form of simulation records and analytical claims and are intended to be openly reusable as a shared specification.

The reference implementation is licensed separately and may evolve independently. Future changes to implementation or licensing are not intended to affect the openness or reusability of the schemas.
